                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Wind energy is a renewable power source that has become increasingly important in the fight against
                    climate change. In Ireland, wind energy is essential to the country's renewable energy mix.
                    According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), wind energy accounted for 36.1% of
                    Ireland's electricity generation in 2020, making it the country's most significant source of
                    renewable energy (SEAI, 2021).</p>
                <p>Wind farms are large installations of wind turbines, which are the primary way of harnessing wind
                    energy. These farms are located in areas with high wind speeds, such as coastal regions and hills.
                    Ireland has made significant progress in developing wind energy and wind farms in recent years. The
                    government has set ambitious targets to increase the country's renewable energy capacity, intending
                    to achieve 70% renewable electricity by 2030 (Government of Ireland, 2019).</p>
                <p>This topic is of great importance as wind energy has the potential to significantly reduce Ireland's
                    dependence on fossil fuels, lower carbon emissions, and enhance energy security. Wind farms can also
                    positively impact the environment, economy, and society. </p>
                <p>This project involves creating a WebMap and WebAtlas (integrated into a GitHub webpage), which
                    explores the number of farms per county, location, and efficiency of wind farms in Ireland. This web
                    map is styled with legends, popups, and marker clusters showing details of each farm. Also, a
                    visualization page was created to give a better view of the spread of each wind farm in each county
                    in Ireland. Ultimately, this project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of wind energy and
                    wind farms in Ireland better to understand their location, quality, and efficiency.</p>
